# CPP Modules - 42 School

`Welcome to my C++ grind at 42!`
This repo tracks my evolution as a C++ dev, from rookie scripts to hardcore object-oriented beasts. Here, every line of code is a step closer to writing clean, fast, and savage C++.

## About the 42 CPP Modules

CPP Modules at 42 School isn’t just a course—it’s a warzone for mastering C++. Through these modules, you’ll conquer:
```
- Data structures and object manipulation
- Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- Operator overloading and templates
- Memory management (pointers, references, RAII)
- C++ best practices and advanced debugging
```
Every project pushes you to think like a C++ ninja, writing code that’s both elegant and brutal in efficiency.

# 🏗️ Module 00 - C++ Fundamentals

Module 00 is your launchpad. It’s where you get your hands dirty with the core mechanics of C++, laying the groundwork for the real beast mode ahead.

## Project 1: Megaphone

`Goal:` Command-line input and string manipulation mastery.

Technical Highlights:
```
- std::cout and std::cerr for stdout and errors
- String and character handling (toupper, concatenation, iteration)
- Command-line arguments (argv)
- Flow control with if, for, while
```
Megaphone is all about turning raw input into amplified output. It’s simple but sharp, and your first taste of processing logic at the core level.

## Project 2: Phonebook

`Goal:` Build a lean, mean contact manager.

Technical Highlights:
```
- Classes with private attributes and public methods (getters and setters)
- Arrays of objects for structured data storage
- User input handling (std::cin) and string validation
- Interactive menu system
- Flow control and data integrity enforcement
```
Phonebook pushes you into object-oriented thinking, forcing you to handle multiple objects, data encapsulation, and interactive logic, all essential for the C++ grind ahead. Implementing interactive program logic,
this is your base! Phonebook and Megaphone are just the tip of the iceberg. From here, it’s full OOP, memory mastery, and code that bites back.
